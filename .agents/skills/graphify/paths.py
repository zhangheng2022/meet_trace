"""Single source of truth for the graphify output-directory name.

The output directory is ``graphify-out`` by default and overridable with the
``GRAPHIFY_OUT`` env var (worktrees or shared-output setups, #686). It accepts a
relative name (``"graphify-out-feature"``) or an absolute path
(``"/shared/graphify-out"``).

This used to be duplicated as an identical ``_GRAPHIFY_OUT`` constant in
``__main__``, ``cache``, and ``watch``, while ``security`` and ``callflow_html``
hardcoded the literal ``"graphify-out"`` and silently ignored the override
(#1423). Centralising it here keeps the name in one place. The value is read
once at import time, matching the previous per-module constants — set
``GRAPHIFY_OUT`` before the process starts (the normal worktree/shared-output
flow) and every reader honours it.
